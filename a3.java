Purpose: Expand an exisiting class to add more attributes and 
         add some additional methods.

    Description:
    -----------
      Modify the GoodDog and GoodDogTestDrive classes from 
      pg. 82 in the text. (See also the example on pg. 62.)
      
      Add the following additional instance variables/attributes to 
      the class:
           - Name 
           - Breed
           - Color
           - Age
  
      In your "TestDrive" code:
        1) make three dog variables/references
        2) create three dogs for those variables
        3) initialize the 3 dogs
        4) display all the attributes of all the dogs
           and have them demonstrate their bark
  
      Repeat the previous 4 steps with an array representing
      a pack of three dogs

      Do not read any inputs, just produce the output.
